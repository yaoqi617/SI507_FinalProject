### Special instructions for running the code:

To run the code, you will need to create an account at https://studio.mapbox.com/. The account is free of charge for the first 50,000 loads, and it should be enough since I only ran less than 30 loads out of 50,000. After creating the account, you click on the account, scroll down to access tokens, and copy the default public token. Then you pass it into the variable called “mapbox_token”.

### How to interact with the program:

There are four options for you to interact:
option 1: Show you all the national parks in your entered state
option 2: Sorted all the national parks in your entered state based on the geographical distance between your current location and the parks in ascending order.
option 3: Show all the national parks in that state on the map
option 4: quit the program

### Recommend to run the code in Google Colab because if you run it locally, you will need to install the plotly package.
